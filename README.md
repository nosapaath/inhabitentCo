== Description ==

This is a custom theme for outdoor company called Inhabitent. 

== Technology == 

For this project I had to use a server (MAMP) and install wordpress. 
First I created a database in MAMP and connect it to my wordpress while I first login to wordpress. 

In VScode, I created templates for different pages/post using php.
Other technologies used were gulp and git. 

Gulp Watch is very useful when you are working with php as you can't see what you are coding right away in the front-end.
